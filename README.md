## About Me

- I am currently working on a group project called [CommuniTEA](https://github.com/CommuniTEAM/CommuniTEA). "CommuniTEA" is a unique application that caters to both businesses and the community, bringing together tea enthusiasts in search of their favorite brews with local establishments ready to serve.

- My most recent application that I had developed is called [Pawsitive Health](https://pawsitive-health.gitlab.io/pawsitive-health/).
